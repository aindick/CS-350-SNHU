# CS-350-SNHU

- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

  The project I worked on was a prototype of a  smart thermostat for a made-up company called SysTec. The problem it solved was to provide SysTec with a prototype thermostat using just a TI board. Eventually, the prototype would lead to an actual smart thermostat that could be used by consumers. The final goal of the project was to be able to send the thermostat data over Wi-Fi also.
  
- What did you do particularly well?

  I think personally I did well on the logic parts of the project. For example, it was required to have the buttons on the TI board to increase and decrease depending on if you pressed either one by 1 degree and it required the degree to decrease by 1 every 200ms. I think I did well with setting this up along with the conditional statements for "heat on" and "heat off" and the LEDs "on/off."
  
- Where could you improve?

  I could definitely improve the state machine diagrams. I feel that I made them very confusing and could've made them simpler than what I have now. If I made the diagrams simpler, I probably wouldn't have had such a tough time figuring out what needed to be done on the project.
  
- What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

  I'm defnitely going to add Texas Instruments' Code Composer Studio to my "toolbox" in case in the future I want to work more with the TI board. Also, the ZyBooks assignments helped me greatly with traversing through this project. I also will be utilizing state diagrams more since they have helped me with figuring out the logic portions of my code.
  
- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

  Some skills I will be using for later projects will be state diagram making, C programming (refreshed C programming knowledge), breaking up the project into smaller, more manageable tasks, and time-management.
  
- How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  
  I made the project more maintainable by splitting up each section of my code that did not belong together, for example, the timer portion and the UART portion I kept separate since they were 2 different functions. I made the code more readable by adding comments and adding spaces between separate functions. Lastly I made the code adaptable by making it easy-to-read and replicate in case someone wanted to enhance it with their own improvements.
